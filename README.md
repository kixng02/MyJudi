about My Judi

Problem Statement 
The covid-19 pandemic amongst other things highlighted how south African citizens participate less in anything that has to do with Judiciary system.As a result of this most people say they are never consulted before new Acts and ammendments in the Judiciary system come to practice.

Proposed Solution: 
My Judiciary App -User will create profile using South African ID number,email,create password -Thereafter user will sign in using ID number and created password -Once logged in , the User can have access to the following: Access to case information Ability to ask questions about certain cases Stream cases live at SA Judiciary channel from youtube subscribe to receive petitions Ability to ask questions about certain case search cases in search bar Stream cases live Components to be added: ablity for user to view and download case information in pdf format within the app

Not only is the My Judi App a revolutionary plartform  to help the general public participate more on the Judiciary System of South Africa
But My JudiApp can have huge impact on scholars of law and other fields of studies as it has the potential to serve as a source of information relating to the South African Judiciary system
Once logged in the user can have access to the following
access to court cases files
stream some high profile cases
Ability to comment before amendment are made
Participate in petitions
